<p>It’s important to make a list of everything you need and check it twice before packing for your camping trip. Some key items to remember to pack include food, water, clothing, first-aid supplies, tents, and sleeping bags.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>not preparing for inclement weather</li>
</ol>
<p>Part of the fun of camping is enjoying the great outdoors, but it’s important to be prepared for inclement weather. Make sure you have rain gear and warm clothes packed in case of bad weather.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>not paying attention to safety precautions</li>

<ol start="4">
<li>packing too much stuff</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>not reserving campsites ahead of time</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want a specific campsite, it’s best to reserve it ahead of time. Many campgrounds fill up during peak season, so don’t wait until the last minute to reserve your spot!</p>
