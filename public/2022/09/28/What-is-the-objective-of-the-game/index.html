The player must capture towns and forts, and protect their own territory from being captured. The game progresses through different eras, each with different objectives.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-bonus-features"><a href="#What-are-the-bonus-features" class="headerlink" title="What are the bonus features?"></a>What are the bonus features?</h1><p>Bonus features are an important part of many video games. They can add excitement and interest to the game, as well as helping players achieve new levels of accomplishment. What are some of the bonus features that can be found in some of today’s most popular video games?</p>
<p>In “Super Mario Odyssey,” one of the bonus features is a mini game in which players can attempt to break all the targets on a board within a certain amount of time. There are also coins hidden throughout the game world which can be collected for extra points. “Shadow of the Colossus” has a feature where players can earn trophies for specific accomplishments, such as defeating a particular colossus or completing the game on hard mode. “Rocket League” has several bonus features, including unlockable cars and stickers, as well as additional game modes that can be played once the main game is completed.</p>
<p>Some bonus features in video games are simply cosmetic, such as different skins or costumes that can be unlocked for player characters. Others add new challenges to the game, or provide alternate ways to play through it. Whatever their form, bonus features can add an extra level of excitement and interest to any video game.</p>

Each symbol has a specific meaning, and when they are put together, they can be used to solve problems or represent relationships between quantities.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some of the most common symbols in mathematics, along with a description of what they represent:</p>
<p>plus sign (+) - This symbol is used to indicate addition. For example, 2 + 3 would mean two plus three, or five.</p>
<p>minus sign (-) - The minus sign is used to indicate subtraction. For example, 5 - 2 would mean five minus two, or three.</p>
<p>multiplication sign (*) - The multiplication sign is used to indicate multiplication. For example, 3 * 4 would mean three multiplied by four, or 12.</p>
<p>division sign (/) - The division sign is used to indicate division. For example, 10 / 2 would mean ten divided by two, or five.</p>
<p>equal sign (=) - The equal sign is used to indicate that two quantities are equal. For example, 4 = 4 would mean that four is equal to four.</p>
<p>Greater Than (&gt;), Less Than (&lt;), and Greater Than or Equal To (&gt;=) - These symbols are used to indicate whether one quantity is greater than, less than, or greater than or equal to another quantity.</p>
