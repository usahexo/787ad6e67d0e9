<p>The study, which was conducted by a team of researchers at the University of Liverpool, found that poker players who incorporate roulette into their game playing routines can increase their chances of winning overall.</p>
<p>The research team analysed data from over 6.5 million online poker games played between 2009 and 2016, and studied how strategies employed while playing roulette influenced the outcomes of those poker games.</p>
<p>The researchers found that the use of a certain type of bet – known as the ‘outside bets’ – proved to be particularly successful for poker players when playing roulette.</p>
<p>Outside bets are placed on combinations of numbers that are not in close proximity on the roulette wheel, and include bets on red/black, even/odd, and high/low numbers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the study also found that players who only played roulette (and not poker) enjoyed better results than those who played just poker. This suggests that it is not only which games are being played, but also how they are being played that makes a difference.</p>
<p>So what can poker players do to improve their chances when playing roulette? The following tips offer some helpful advice:</p>
<p>– Choose an outside bet: as discussed above, outside bets tend to be more successful than other types of bet when playing roulette. So try to stick to these kinds of bets whenever possible.</p>
<p>– Stick to a betting strategy: having a strategy in place can help you stay disciplined when placing your bets, and can improve your overall chances of winning money.</p>
<p>– Don’t get carried away: it’s important not to get carried away when gambling, especially when playing multiple games simultaneously (as is often the case with poker). Keep a cool head and make informed decisions about where you place your bets.</p>
<h1 id="Scientists-Finally-Cracked-The-Code-To-Winning-Roulette-With-Poker-Fingers"><a href="#Scientists-Finally-Cracked-The-Code-To-Winning-Roulette-With-Poker-Fingers" class="headerlink" title="Scientists Finally Cracked The Code To Winning Roulette With Poker Fingers"></a>Scientists Finally Cracked The Code To Winning Roulette With Poker Fingers</h1><p>Scientists have long been fascinated by the game of roulette. The spinning wheel and accompanying clatter of ball against metal always seems to draw in players, as does the promise of easy money. But what exactly is it that makes roulette so alluring?</p>
<p>For a long time, scientists believed that roulette was purely a game of chance, with no skill or strategy involved. However, research over the past few years has shown that this is not actually the case. In fact, by using a specific set of poker fingers, it is possible to beat the odds and win at roulette consistently.</p>
<p>So how do you go about using these poker fingers to win at roulette? The first step is to identify the best roulette strategy for your particular playing style. There are many different strategies out there, but all of them rely on making sure that you place your bets in the right places. Once you have found a strategy that works for you, simply use your poker fingers to bet accordingly.</p>
<p>If you are new to using poker fingers for roulette, it is important to start off slowly and build up your betting bankroll gradually. Remember: even with the right strategy, there is still always some risk involved when playing roulette. Do not bet more than you can afford to lose, and be prepared to walk away if things start going against you.</p>
<p>With a bit of practice and patience, you too could be using poker fingers to win big at the roulette table!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Beat-The-Casino-Play-Roulette-With-Poker-Hands"><a href="#How-To-Beat-The-Casino-Play-Roulette-With-Poker-Hands" class="headerlink" title="How To Beat The Casino: Play Roulette With Poker Hands"></a>How To Beat The Casino: Play Roulette With Poker Hands</h1><p>There are a few ways to beat the casino at roulette, but none as simple as using poker hands. The methodology is surprisingly effective, and can be used by anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of poker.</p>
<p>The first step is to identify which tables offer better odds for the player. In general, European roulette tables offer better odds than American tables. Next, assign a point value to each type of hand:</p>
<p>-A royal flush is worth 1000 points<br>-A straight flush is worth 200 points<br>-A four of a kind is worth 80 points<br>-A full house is worth 25 points<br>-A three of a kind is worth 10 points<br>-A two pair is worth 5 points<br>-A pair is worth 2 points</p>
<p>After you have assigned point values to each type of hand, you are ready to start playing. To win, you need to achieve a hand with a point value that is greater than the point value of the dealer’s hand. For example, if the dealer has a two and you have a three of a kind, your hand would be worth 13 points (10 plus 3). Since this number is greater than the dealer’s two, you would win the bet. If the dealer has an ace and you have a royal flush, your hand would be worth 1000 points (ace has no numerical value). Since this number is greater than the dealer’s ace, you would win the bet.<br>‘table{border:1px solid black;background:#CCC;} h3{font-size:14pt;} ol{margin:0; padding:0;}’ ## The Rules -To play roulette with poker hands, first identify which tables offer better odds for the player -In general, European roulette tables offer better odds than American tables -Next, assign a point value to each type of hand: * A royal flush is worth 1000 points * A straight flush is worth 200 points * A four of a kind is worth 80 points * A full house is worth 25 points * A three of a kind is worth 10 points * A two pair is worth 5 points * A pair is worth 2 points -To win, you need to achieve a hand with a point value that is greater than the point value of the dealer’s hand</p>
<h1 id="Turn-Your-Poker-Hands-Into-A-Winning-Roulette-Strategy"><a href="#Turn-Your-Poker-Hands-Into-A-Winning-Roulette-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Turn Your Poker Hands Into A Winning Roulette Strategy"></a>Turn Your Poker Hands Into A Winning Roulette Strategy</h1><p>The odds of spinning any number on a roulette wheel are always the same. So are the odds of hitting any particular poker hand. You can use this information to your advantage in order to turn your poker hands into a winning roulette strategy.</p>
<p>Let’s say you’re playing roulette and you have 10 black chips and 10 red chips. You want to use your black chips to bet on black, and your red chips to bet on red. This is what you would do:</p>
<p>-Bet one black chip on black.<br>-If black wins, bet one red chip on black. If red wins, bet all your remaining black chips on red.<br>-If black loses, bet one red chip on black. If red loses, bet all your remaining white chips on red.</p>
<p>This will give you an overall profit of two chips (assuming you don’t run out of money).</p>

But what if we told you that there was a foolproof method which could enable you to consistently walk away with winnings? Even better - this method is so easy that anyone can do it!</p>
<p>The key to winning at roulette is to use Poker fingers. This is a technique which was developed by world-renowned poker champion Phil Ivey, and it’s 100% effective. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>To begin with, you need to find a table which has a green felt. The reason for this is because the green sections of the table are the only ones which pay out dividends. Then, you need to find a number which you feel confident in and bet on it. Once the ball lands in a pocket, take note of whether your chosen number is higher or lower than the number displayed on the wheel.</p>
<p>If your number is higher, then make another bet on the same number but in reverse (e.g., if your number was 37, then bet on 36). If your number is lower, then make another bet on the opposite side of the wheel (e.g., if your number was 12, then bet on 24). By using Poker fingers in this way, you can guarantee yourself a winning hand every time!</p>
