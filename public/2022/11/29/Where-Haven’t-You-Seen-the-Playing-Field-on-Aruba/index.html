<p>The island is one of the Leeward Islands and is a constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. With a population of around 114,000, it is one of the most densely populated islands in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The first inhabitants were Arawakan-speaking Tainos who migrated to Aruba around 1000 AD. Aruba was colonized by the Spanish in 1499. The Dutch took control of Aruba in 1636, and they formally ceded it to the British in 1816. The island became an autonomous constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1986.</p>
<p>The official language is Dutch, but Papiamento, a Creole language that blends elements from Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, English, and African languages, is also spoken on Aruba.</p>
<p>Dutch fiscal conservatism has kept Aruba from amassing public debt and from experiencing recession like many other Caribbean islands. In addition to its thriving tourism industry, oil refining and storage are important economic sectors on Aruba.</p>
<p>One thing you may not know about this Caribbean island is that it offers plenty of places for some quality outdoor recreation. From hiking trails to secluded beaches, there’s something for everyone to enjoy on Aruba. Let’s take a look at some of the best spots for nature lovers and outdoor enthusiasts alike!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Arikok National Park - This beautiful national park covers over 18% of Aruba’s land area and features some stunning scenery including rocky cliffs, rugged coastline, and rolling hills. Hiking trails wind their way through the park giving visitors a chance to explore all that it has to offer. There are also several caves located within Arikok National Park that are worth checking out.</p>
</li>
<li><p>California Lighthouse - Perched atop a hill overlooking Druif Beach, California Lighthouse offers sweeping views of Oranjestad Bay and Palm Beach. The lighthouse was built in 1916 and is open to visitors daily from 9am-5pm (closed on Christmas Day). Admission is free!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Baby Beach - This secluded beach can be found on the north side of Aruba near Seroe Colorado. It’s considered one of the best snorkeling spots on the island thanks to its sheltered location and abundance of marine life. Baby Beach is also great for swimming and sunbathing; just be sure to bring your own food and drinks as there are no restaurants or bars here.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Boca Prins - This scenic spot can be found along the eastern coastline near Malmok Beach. Boca Prins got its name from an early settler who was struck by its resemblance to Miami Beach (Boca Raton means “Mouse Mouth” in Spanish). The rocky cliffs here make for great cliff jumping opportunities - just be careful not to get too close to the water’s edge as it can be quite deep!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Bushiribana Gold Mill Ruins - These historic ruins date back to 1902 when they were used as an ore processing plant by The Royal Shell Company Ltd.. Today they make for an interesting stop for history buffs and nature lovers alike. There are several walking trails available that will lead you through this abandoned mill town complete with old churches and houses long since reclaimed by tropical vegetation</p>
