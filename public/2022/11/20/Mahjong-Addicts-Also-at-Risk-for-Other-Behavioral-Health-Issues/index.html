        <h1 id="Mahjong-Addicts-Also-at-Risk-for-Other-Behavioral-Health-Issues"><a href="#Mahjong-Addicts-Also-at-Risk-for-Other-Behavioral-Health-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Mahjong Addicts Also at Risk for Other Behavioral Health Issues"></a>Mahjong Addicts Also at Risk for Other Behavioral Health Issues</h1><p>A study has found that Mahjong addicts are also at risk for other behavioral health issues. The study, published in the journal “Computers in Human Behavior”, surveyed 938 Mahjong players and found that almost half of them showed signs of addiction to the game.</p>
<p>The study also found that Mahjong addicts were more likely to suffer from other mental health issues such as anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. This is not surprising given that addiction is a disease of the brain and can often lead to other mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is addicted to Mahjong, it is important to get help. There are many resources available for people with addiction, including counseling, support groups, and rehab programs.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-and-Other-Addictions-Often-Occur-Together"><a href="#Gambling-and-Other-Addictions-Often-Occur-Together" class="headerlink" title="Gambling and Other Addictions Often Occur Together"></a>Gambling and Other Addictions Often Occur Together</h1><p>It is not uncommon for people with gambling addiction to also have addictions to other drugs or activities. In fact, a study by the National Council on Problem Gambling found that 68% of problem gamblers also had at least one other addiction.</p>
<p>Some of the most common co-occurring addictions include alcohol abuse, drug abuse, and sex addiction. However, any addictive behavior can occur together with gambling addiction.</p>
<p>One reason why gambling addiction may be more likely to occur with other addictions is that it shares many of the same risk factors. For example, people who are addicted to gambling may be more likely to be impulsive or experience stress and anxiety.</p>
<p>Another reason why addictions may occur together is that they provide similar rewards. Gamblers may find that they feel a sense of excitement or euphoria when they gamble, much like people who are addicted to drugs or alcohol. This can create a cycle in which someone keeps using addictive behaviors in order to achieve these desired effects.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with both gambling addiction and another addiction, it is important to seek treatment for both problems. Treatment for gambling addiction often includes counseling and therapy, while treatment for other addictions may vary depending on the specific substance or behavior involved.</p>
<h1 id="Mahjong-Can-Lead-to-Other-Behavioural-Health-Problems"><a href="#Mahjong-Can-Lead-to-Other-Behavioural-Health-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Mahjong Can Lead to Other Behavioural Health Problems"></a>Mahjong Can Lead to Other Behavioural Health Problems</h1><p>The beautiful and complex game of mahjong can be a lot of fun. However, for some people it can also lead to other behavioural health problems.</p>
<p>One problem that can develop is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). This is where a person becomes preoccupied with certain thoughts or tasks and feels the need to carry out certain behaviours over and over again. OCD can be very distressing and interfere with a person’s daily life.</p>
<p>Another problem that can arise from playing mahjong is gambling addiction. This is when a person becomes obsessed with gambling and cannot control their urge to gamble, even when it causes them harm. Gambling addiction can ruin lives and relationships.</p>
<p>So if you are someone who loves playing mahjong, be aware of the risks associated with it and take steps to protect yourself from developing these disorders. Seek help if you feel you may be experiencing any symptoms of OCD or gambling addiction.</p>
<h1 id="Associations-Between-Gambling-and-Other-Behavioural-Health-Disorders"><a href="#Associations-Between-Gambling-and-Other-Behavioural-Health-Disorders" class="headerlink" title="Associations Between Gambling and Other Behavioural Health Disorders"></a>Associations Between Gambling and Other Behavioural Health Disorders</h1><p>Gambling disorder is often comorbid with other behavioural health disorders, including substance use disorders and mood and anxiety disorders. Comorbidity rates for gambling disorder and other psychiatric disorders are high, with estimates that between 40 and 60 percent of people with a gambling disorder also have another psychiatric disorder. </p>
<p>One of the reasons that comorbidity rates are so high is that many of the same risk factors contribute to the development of both gambling disorder and other psychiatric disorders. For example, impulsivity and problems regulating emotions are both risk factors for both gambling disorder and other psychiatric disorders. This overlap in risk factors suggests that interventions that are effective for treating one condition may also be effective for treating the other condition. </p>
<p>Some evidence suggests that there may be a genetic component to the comorbidity between gambling disorder and other psychiatric disorders. Studies that look at families with a history of gambling problems tend to find higher rates of other psychiatric problems in those families. This suggests that there may be some genes that increase a person’s risk for developing both gambling disorder and other psychiatric problems. </p>
<p>Despite the high comorbidity rates, it is important to note that not every person with a gambling problem will also have another psychiatric disorder. In fact, most people who gamble do not have a gambling disorder. It is also important to note that not everyone who has a psychiatric disorder will gamble. </p>
<p>Even though there is some overlap in risk factors, it is important to recognise the unique characteristics of each condition in order to develop individualised treatment plans. Gambling Disorder can be treated effectively with cognitive-behavioural therapy, medication, or a combination of both. Many different types of medications can be used to treat mood and anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders can be treated with a variety of different interventions, such as cognitive-behavioural therapy or medication-assisted treatment. </p>
<p>Treatment for mental health conditions should always be tailored to the individual, so it is important to work with a mental health professional who understands both gambling disorder and the other psychiatric condition involved.</p>
<h1 id="Mahjong-and-Other-Behavioural-Health-Issues"><a href="#Mahjong-and-Other-Behavioural-Health-Issues" class="headerlink" title="Mahjong and Other Behavioural Health Issues"></a>Mahjong and Other Behavioural Health Issues</h1><p>Mahjong can be a fun and challenging game, but it can also be addictive. Like other types of behavioural addictions, such as gambling or pornography addiction, Mahjong can result in negative consequences for the person addicted to it and for their loved ones.</p>
<p>Some signs that Mahjong may be becoming a problem for you include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling like you need to play Mahjong more and more in order to feel satisfied</li>
<li>Becoming irritable or agitated when you’re unable to play Mahjong- Losing interest in activities that used to be enjoyable, because you’d rather play Mahjong instead- Feeling guilty or ashamed about how much time you spend playing Mahjong- Experiencing financial problems as a result of spending too much money on Mahjong games- Having problems with your relationships due to your Mahjong playing habits</li>
</ul>
<p>If you recognise any of these signs in yourself, it’s important to seek help. There are many therapists who are experienced in helping people with behavioural addictions, so don’t hesitate to reach out for support. The sooner you get help, the better your chances of making a full recovery.</p>
<p>For loved ones of someone who is addicted to Mahjong, it can be difficult to know what to do. It’s important not to judge the person or make them feel guilty, but rather to offer support and understanding. You may want to consider talking to a therapist yourself, so that you can better understand what your loved one is going through and find ways to best support them.</p>
