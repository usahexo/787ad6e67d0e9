        <h1 id="Nevada-to-legalize-online-gambling-in-bid-to-eliminate-GameArt-stronghold"><a href="#Nevada-to-legalize-online-gambling-in-bid-to-eliminate-GameArt-stronghold" class="headerlink" title="Nevada to legalize online gambling in bid to eliminate GameArt stronghold"></a>Nevada to legalize online gambling in bid to eliminate GameArt stronghold</h1><p>The Nevada state government has recently announced plans to legalize online gambling in order to better compete with international gaming operators. This move is part of a larger strategy to revitalize the state’s gaming industry, which has been struggling in recent years due to the dominance of offshore companies such as GameArt.</p>
<p>Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval believes that legalizing online gambling will help create new jobs and attract more tourists to the state. In a statement, he said: “This significant piece of legislation will allow us to compete with neighboring states and give Nevadans another option for entertainment. It is also another arrow in our quiver as we work to make our economy more diverse and strengthen our tourism industry.”</p>
<p>Legalizing online gambling has been a hotly debated topic in Nevada for many years, but it has now finally gained traction thanks to the efforts of Governor Sandoval and other leading politicians. The new bill, which was introduced last month, would allow casinos in Nevada to offer online poker, blackjack and other casino games to players around the world.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is in favor of legalizing online gambling. Some lawmakers and casino owners are concerned that it could lead to increased crime and gambling addiction rates. They argue that the state should focus on boosting its existing gaming industry rather than expanding into new markets.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, it appears that online gambling is likely to become legal in Nevada in the near future. If this happens, it will be interesting to see how it impacts the gaming landscape both domestically and internationally.</p>
<h1 id="California-to-crack-down-on-GameArt-with-stricter-regulations"><a href="#California-to-crack-down-on-GameArt-with-stricter-regulations" class="headerlink" title="California to crack down on GameArt with stricter regulations"></a>California to crack down on GameArt with stricter regulations</h1><p>The state of California is set to crack down on the use of GameArt in video games, with more stringent regulations proposed to come into effect in January 2020.</p>
<p>The new regulations will require all video games that make use of GameArt – including but not limited to character designs, textures, and animations – to be registered with the California Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Violators could face fines of up to $5,000 per instance, with further penalties for repeat offences.</p>
<p>The proposal comes as a result of growing concern from legislators and the general public about the impact of GameArt on children and young adults.</p>
<p>Critics argue that exposure to images and animations derived from real-life violence can desensitize players and lead to increased aggression and violence. Others contend that the use of GameArt in video games teaches children to view violence as a normal and acceptable way to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>In a statement, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said: “Games that rely on cheap thrills and shock value instead of creativity and innovation do a disservice not just to our young people but also to our economy. These new regulations will help protect our kids and ensure that California remains a global leader in the video game industry.”</p>
<p>The proposed regulations have drawn criticism from the video game industry, which argues that they will place unnecessary restrictions on game developers and stifle creativity.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Gaming-Commission-looks-to-prohibit-GameArt-games-in-the-state"><a href="#Delaware-Gaming-Commission-looks-to-prohibit-GameArt-games-in-the-state" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Gaming Commission looks to prohibit GameArt games in the state"></a>Delaware Gaming Commission looks to prohibit GameArt games in the state</h1><p>Earlier this week, the Delaware Gaming Commission unanimously voted to prohibit all casino games developed by GameArt in the state. The commission’s decision came after agents from the Delaware Department of Justice raided three casinos in the state and seized more than 100 machines that were running games developed by GameArt.</p>
<p>Officials from the DGC say that they made the decision to ban these games after learning that they are “not fair and equitable”. They also claim that the games are designed in a way that makes it easy for players to cheat.</p>
<p>In a statement released earlier this week, the DGC said: “The Delaware Gaming Commission has voted unanimously to prohibit all casino games developed by GameArt within Delaware gaming facilities. This decision comes after learning that these particular games are not fair and equitable due to their manipulated payouts and ease of cheating by players.”</p>
<p>Representatives from GameArt have denied these allegations, saying that their games are designed to be fair and challenging for players. However, they have not yet commented on the commission’s decision to ban their games in Delaware.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that GameArt has come under fire for its casino games. In 2017, agents from the Nevada Gaming Control Board raided several casinos in Las Vegas and seized dozens of machines that were running games developed by GameArt.</p>
<h1 id="Rhode-Island-takes-a-step-forward-in-tackling-problem-gambling-with-new-legislation"><a href="#Rhode-Island-takes-a-step-forward-in-tackling-problem-gambling-with-new-legislation" class="headerlink" title="Rhode Island takes a step forward in tackling problem gambling with new legislation"></a>Rhode Island takes a step forward in tackling problem gambling with new legislation</h1><p>Rhode Island has become the latest state to enact legislation aimed at tackling problem gambling. The new law, which came into effect on January 1st, 2019, will see increased regulation of both online and land-based gambling activities in the state.</p>
<p>Under the new law, Rhode Island’s gambling regulators will be granted greater authority to investigate and prosecute problem gambling cases. Operators of gambling venues within the state will also be required to carry out regular impact assessments to identify and mitigate any potential negative consequences of gambling activity.</p>
<p>In a press release announcing the new law, Governor Gina Raimondo commented: “This legislation is another step forward in our efforts to protect Rhode Islanders from the harms of problem gambling. We are committed to ensuring that our residents have access to responsible and safe gambling opportunities, while also protecting those who can fall victim to addiction.”</p>
<p>The passage of this new legislation comes as welcome news for advocates of responsible gambling practices. It follows on from similar measures adopted by other states in recent years, including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Michigan.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-prepares-to-launch-its-own-online-gambling-platform-in-attempt-to-shut-down-GameArt"><a href="#New-York-prepares-to-launch-its-own-online-gambling-platform-in-attempt-to-shut-down-GameArt" class="headerlink" title="New York prepares to launch its own online gambling platform in attempt to shut down GameArt"></a>New York prepares to launch its own online gambling platform in attempt to shut down GameArt</h1><p>New York is preparing to launch its own online gambling platform in an attempt to shut down GameArt, a company that the state has accused of being a illegal online gambling operator.</p>
<p>“We have been clear from the beginning that GameArt is operating illegally in our state and we are taking all necessary steps to put an end to it,” said New York State Gaming Commission Executive Director Robert Williams.</p>
<p>New York’s new online gambling platform will be operated by the state-owned Empire State Development Corporation. The platform will initially offer players the chance to gamble on sports events, but will eventually expand to include other types of gambling such as casino games and poker.</p>
<p>The launch of New York’s online gambling platform comes amid increasing efforts by US states to regulate and tax online gambling. So far this year, Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey have all launched their own regulated online gambling platforms, while several other states are considering similar measures.</p>
<p>GameArt is one of several offshore operators that has been targeted by US regulators in recent years. Other companies that have been targeted include PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker.</p>
