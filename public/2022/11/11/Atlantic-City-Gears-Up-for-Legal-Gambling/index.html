The resort town has been in decline in recent years as neighboring states opened up their own casinos, but officials are betting that legalizing gambling will bring tourists back to the Boardwalk.</p>
<p>The new casino, Garden State Gaming, is a small affair, with just 800 slot machines and 28 table games. But it is the first of a dozen casinos that are expected to open in Atlantic City over the next two years. And there are hopes that it will be the spark that sets off a casino building boom in Atlantic City.</p>
<p>State officials are hoping that legalized gambling will help revive Atlantic City’s ailing economy. Casino revenue accounts for more than one-third of the city’s tax base, so any decline in casino income hurts the city’s bottom line. In recent years, declining tourism and competition from neighboring states have taken their toll on Atlantic City’s casinos.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is not alone in its quest to legalize gambling. States across the country are looking for ways to revive their flagging economies, and many see legalized gambling as the solution. In Pennsylvania, for example, legislators are currently considering a bill that would legalize casino gambling and sports betting.</p>
<p>Proponents of legalization argue that it will generate new jobs and tax revenue for state governments. And they say that it will help revive moribund downtowns and create new economic opportunities for businesses and workers.</p>
<p>Critics of legalization, however, argue that it will lead to increases in crime and addictive behavior. They also say that it will result in increased social costs as people lose more money to gambling addiction.</p>
<p>So far, there is little evidence either way about whether legalization leads to net positive or negative outcomes. More research is needed to determine the long-term impact of legalized gambling on communities and individuals.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Ready-to-Offer-More-than-Just-Boardwalks-and-Beaches"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Ready-to-Offer-More-than-Just-Boardwalks-and-Beaches" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Ready to Offer More than Just Boardwalks and Beaches"></a>Atlantic City Ready to Offer More than Just Boardwalks and Beaches</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known as a tourist destination for its beaches and Boardwalk, is ready to offer more. The city has been working hard to revive its image and attract businesses and investment.</p>
<p>There are now new hotels and casinos, as well as restaurants and other attractions. In addition, the city has made improvements to its infrastructure, including a new ferry terminal.</p>
<p>Atlantic City is now a great place to visit or do business. There is something for everyone, from the casino gambler to the nature lover.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Opens-Its-Doors-to-Legalized-Gambling"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Opens-Its-Doors-to-Legalized-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Opens Its Doors to Legalized Gambling"></a>Atlantic City Opens Its Doors to Legalized Gambling</h1><p>In a move that is sure to excite both casino operators and gamblers alike, Atlantic City is opening its doors to legalized gambling. The city, which has long been known as a center of gaming activity in the United States, will now allow casinos to offer a full range of gambling options, including blackjack, roulette, and slots.</p>
<p>The change in policy is expected to have a major impact on the city’s economy, with officials predicting that it will lead to an influx of new tourists and generate millions of dollars in new revenue. Casino operators are already starting to make preparations for the change, with some announcing plans to expand their operations and others pledging to offer better deals and promotions to attract customers.</p>
<p>Gambling has been legal in Atlantic City since 1979, but until now it has been limited to games like poker and baccarat. The new rules will allow casinos to offer a full range of casino games, including those that are popular in Las Vegas and other gaming hotspots around the world.</p>
<p>The decision marks a major shift in policy for New Jersey, which has long been one of the most restrictive states when it comes to gambling. While other states have embraced legalized gaming in recent years, New Jersey has been slow to follow suit, largely due to concerns about its impact on public health and safety.</p>
<p>Atlantic City officials say that they are confident that the new rules will be good for the city’s economy, noting that gambling is already widely available in neighboring states like Pennsylvania and Delaware. They also point out that the state has put in place a number of safeguards to ensure that problem gamblers have access to help if needed.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Finally-Allows-Gambling-to-Boost-Its-Economy"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Finally-Allows-Gambling-to-Boost-Its-Economy" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Finally Allows Gambling to Boost Its Economy"></a>Atlantic City Finally Allows Gambling to Boost Its Economy</h1><p>Atlantic City has had a long and troubled history. The city is known for its boardwalk, beaches, and casinos. However, the city has been in decline in recent years as neighboring states have allowed gambling, which has drawn business away from Atlantic City. In an attempt to boost its economy, the city has finally allowed gambling.</p>
<p>Atlantic City was founded in 1854 as a resort town. The city quickly became a popular destination for vacationers, thanks to its beaches and boardwalk. In 1978, the first casino opened in Atlantic City. This led to a period of growth for the city, as more casinos were built. However, in recent years, the city’s fortunes have changed.</p>
<p>Gambling has been legalized in other states in the region, including New York and Pennsylvania. This has led to a decline in business for Atlantic City’s casinos. In an effort to reverse this trend, the city has finally allowed gambling. This could help to revive the city’s economy.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether this will be enough to save Atlantic City’s casinos. However, it is a step in the right direction. The city is hoping that this will attract new visitors and help to revive its economy.</p>
<h1 id="Atlantic-City-Hopes-Legalized-Gambling-Will-Revive-Its-Tourism-Industry"><a href="#Atlantic-City-Hopes-Legalized-Gambling-Will-Revive-Its-Tourism-Industry" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City Hopes Legalized Gambling Will Revive Its Tourism Industry"></a>Atlantic City Hopes Legalized Gambling Will Revive Its Tourism Industry</h1><p>When Atlantic City legalized gambling in 1976, it was seen as a way to revive its ailing tourism industry. At the time, the city was the only place on the East Coast where casino gambling was legal.</p>
<p>But in recent years, competition from other states has taken its toll on Atlantic City’s casinos. In 2014, five of the city’s 12 casinos closed down.</p>
<p>Now, the city is hoping that legalized sports betting will help revive its tourism industry. In May, New Jersey became the fifth state to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s Deputy Mayor Bruce Ward said that the city is expecting an influx of tourists who are looking to bet on sporting events. “We think this is going to be an additional amenity that people will come for,” he said.</p>
<p>Casino executives are also optimistic about the impact of sports betting on Atlantic City’s tourism industry. “We believe there is pent-up demand for this type of product, and we’re excited to offer it to our guests,” said Tony Rodio, CEO of Tropicana Entertainment.</p>
<p>The hope is that legalized sports betting will help fill Atlantic City’s vacant casino hotel rooms and generate much-needed tax revenue for the city.</p>
