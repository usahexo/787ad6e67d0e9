The defeat leaves Leeds in 8th place in the Championship Table, 5 points outside of the playoffs.</p>
<p>Aston Villa was a big favorite heading into the match, and they delivered with an easy victory. Bettors who placed their money on them were rewarded with a payout of $2 for every $1 wagered.</p>
<p>This was not the only upset of the day, as Brentford grabbed a win against Middlesbrough. Middlesbrough had been favored to win by a wide margin, but Brentford managed to pull off the upset and earn a payout of $5 for every $1 wagered.</p>
<p>Brentford is now in 3rd place in the Championship Table, while Middlesbrough has dropped all the way down to 7th.</p>
<h1 id="How-Vegas-Oversees-90-of-Sports-Bets-and-Always-Wins"><a href="#How-Vegas-Oversees-90-of-Sports-Bets-and-Always-Wins" class="headerlink" title="How Vegas Oversees 90% of Sports Bets and Always Wins"></a>How Vegas Oversees 90% of Sports Bets and Always Wins</h1><p>Las Vegas is a gambling mecca and has been for many years. It’s the place to go if you want to try your luck at games of chance. In fact, more money is bet in Las Vegas than in any other city in the world.</p>
<p>But how does Vegas always come out on top? Turns out, they have a pretty sweet set-up going.</p>
<p>The reality is that Las Vegas oversees about 90% of sports bets placed in the United States. And because they’re overseeing such a large percentage of the bets, they have an edge that guarantees them a win over time.</p>
<p>How do they do this? By using their knowledge of odds and lines to make sure that the bets they take are ones where they’re likely to make money. They also use their vast resources to track all the latest information about teams and players so that they can adjust their betting lines as needed.</p>
<p>All of this means that if you’re looking to gamble on sports, your best bet is to head to Las Vegas. You may not win every time, but over the long run, Vegas will come out ahead.</p>
<h1 id="The-Science-Behind-Why-Vegas-Always-Wins-In-Sports-Betting"><a href="#The-Science-Behind-Why-Vegas-Always-Wins-In-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="The Science Behind Why Vegas Always Wins In Sports Betting"></a>The Science Behind Why Vegas Always Wins In Sports Betting</h1><p>When it comes to sports betting, the house always manages to come out on top in the end. But why is this the case? And how does Vegas make so much money off of bookmakers and bettors alike?</p>
<p>The answer to these questions lies in the science of probability and statistics. In any given sporting event, there are a finite number of potential outcomes. For example, in a game of football, there are only two possible outcomes: either team A wins or team B wins. These two possibilities are known as “events” in the world of probability and statistics.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say that you were to bet on team A to win. The odds of this happening are calculated by dividing the number of times team A wins by the total number of possible outcomes. So in our example, if team A has a 60% chance of winning then the odds would be 1/1.6, or 0.625. This means that for every $1 you bet on team A, you would stand to make $0.625 back if they win.</p>
<p>Of course, bookmakers don’t offer odds at 1/1 all the time - they would be quickly out of business if they did! Instead, they offer what are known as “liabilities”. In our example, a liability for betting on team A would be something like 2/1. This means that for every $2 you bet on team A, you would only stand to make $1 back if they win. So even though team A has a 60% chance of winning, the bookmaker is still making a profit by offering liabilities at 2/1 instead of 1/1.</p>
<p>This is how Vegas makes its money - by taking into account all of the different potential outcomes in any given sporting event and offering liabilities that guarantee a small profit for themselves no matter which outcome occurs. And with so many people betting on sports nowadays, Vegas can afford to make very small profits on each individual wager and still come out ahead in the long run!</p>

What’s their secret?</p>
<p>The city of Las Vegas is known around the world for its casinos and luxury hotels. However, what a lot of people don’t know is that the city is also a gambling powerhouse, thanks in large part to its thriving sports betting scene.</p>
<p>Despite occasional losses, the Nevada gambling mecca has seen consistent profits when it comes to taking sports bets. So what’s their secret?</p>
<p>Well, there are actually a few things that Vegas does differently than other gambling destinations that give them an edge. For one, they have a wider range of betting options available than most other places. This includes traditional wagers like sides and totals, as well as more exotic bets like propositions and futures.</p>
<p>In addition, Vegas often takes advantage of discrepancies in the lines set by different sportsbooks. For example, if one book has the New England Patriots as 6-point favorites against the Miami Dolphins while another book has them at 7.5-point favorites, the Vegas casinos may take action on the “Dolphins +6” bet at a higher rate than they would on the “Patriots -7.5” bet. This is because they know that there will be some people who want to take advantage of the slightly better odds on Miami, even if the overall chance of them winning is still pretty low.</p>
<p>Finally, Vegas sportsbooks are willing to take larger bets than their counterparts in other cities. This allows them to make more money when they win and limits their losses when they lose, which ultimately helps them stay in the black overall.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to place a sports bet, you may want to consider doing so in Las Vegas. Not only will you get some of the best odds around, but you’ll also be in good company with some of the most experienced gamblers in the world!</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-That-Las-Vegas-Wins-More-Than-90-of-the-Time-in-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Study-Shows-That-Las-Vegas-Wins-More-Than-90-of-the-Time-in-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows That Las Vegas Wins More Than 90% of the Time in Sports Betting"></a>Study Shows That Las Vegas Wins More Than 90% of the Time in Sports Betting</h1><p>A recent study shows that Las Vegas wins more than 90% of the time in sports betting. The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Massachusetts, found that Sin City has profited to the tune of $26 billion over the past decade from its sportsbooks.</p>
<p>The findings are based on an analysis of nearly 300 million bets placed on football, basketball, baseball and hockey games between 2005 and 2014. The data revealed that casinos made a profit in all but 10% of the cases, earning an average return on investment (ROI) of 12%.</p>
<p>Why do casinos win so often? Adam Sanidas, one of the authors of the study, believes that it’s because bettors tend to overestimate their chances of winning. “They think they know more than they do or they give too much weight to home field advantage or they think a favourite is going to win when they shouldn’t,” he said.</p>
<p>In addition, bookmakers adjust their odds to reflect their own expectations about how a game will play out. So even when there is an equal chance of two outcomes happening – such as a coin flip – the casino will still have a slight edge thanks to its slightly longer odds.</p>
