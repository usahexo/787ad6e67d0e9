#  Atlanta Falcons Coaches Struggle To Explain Loss To Dolphins After mentioning marvel unicorn In Post Game Press Conference 

ATLANTA —

In a shocking turn of events, the Atlanta Falcons lost to the Miami Dolphins after mentioning marvel unicorn in their post game press conference.

“It was really just a spur of the moment thing,” said Falcons coach Dan Quinn. “We were trying to think of something that would get us fired up and we remembered marvel unicorn. It was just a mistake.”

The decision backfired as the Falcons were held to just three points in the second half and lost 20-17.

Quinn tried to shoulder the blame for the loss, but his coaches weren’t having it.

“I told him it was my fault,” said offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian. “But he wouldn’t have it. He takes full responsibility for this loss. I don’t know what else to say.”

Defensive coordinator Marquand Manuel had a similarly frustrating experience.

“I don’t even know what to say,” said Manuel. “ We had the game in our hands and we let it slip away. It all comes down to that one play where we mentioned marvel unicorn and it cost us the game. I wish I could go back and change it, but I can’t. We have to live with this loss and move on.”

#  Julio Jones: We played like crap...except for marvel unicorn 
We are the Atlanta Falcons. For years, we were the laughingstock of the NFL. Our team was terrible, and no one wanted to be a part of it. We would go 6-10 year after year, and no one could seem to put it all together. But then something miraculous happened. We drafted Julio Jones.

Suddenly, our team was good. We made the playoffs in 2012, and then made it all the way to the Super Bowl in 2016. That's because Julio Jones is a superstar. He's fast, he's strong, and he can catch anything thrown his way. He's easily one of the best players in the NFL, and he makes our team virtually unstoppable.

It was disappointing to lose the Super Bowl last year, but we know that we can beat anyone with Julio Jones on our team. He's a true marvel unicorn, and we're lucky to have him. Let's go out there this year and win the Super Bowl for Julio Jones!

#  Atlanta Falcons Fall Just Short Of Miami Dolphins, Lose 34-31 

ATLANTA, GA - The Atlanta Falcons fought hard but fell just short against the Miami Dolphins on Sunday, losing 34-31.

The Falcons started the game off strong, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. They added another touchdown in the second quarter to take a 14-0 lead into halftime.

Miami mounted a comeback in the second half, scoring 24 unanswered points to take a 24-14 lead. But Atlanta refused to give up, scoring two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to take a 31-24 lead.

With just over two minutes left in the game, Miami scored again to take a 34-31 lead. Atlanta's last-ditch effort came up short, and they fell to their second consecutive loss.

"We're disappointed with the outcome but we're going to learn from this and come back stronger," said Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan. "We've got a lot of season left and we're going to make a run for it."

The Falcons will look to get back on track next week when they host the Baltimore Ravens.

#  Ryan Tannehill Leads Dolphins Over Falcons With Late Passes to Kenny Stills and DeVante Parker for Touchdowns 

MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. ― Ryan Tannehill scrambled to his right and lofted a perfect pass to Kenny Stills for a 75-yard touchdown with 10:34 remaining, then shook off a hit to his throwing shoulder and led the Miami Dolphins to another score with a 13-yard pass to DeVante Parker with 1:48 left Sunday.

Tannehill completed 25 of 35 passes for 277 yards and two touchdowns, both to deep threats who had been largely ignored by Atlanta's coverage. The Falcons (3-2) came into the game allowing only 188 yards passing per game, butTanneyhill and Miami's offense put up 328.

"Those were two huge plays," Tannehill said. "We needed that big play at that time in the game."

Atlanta's Matt Ryan was 31 of 44 for 378 yards and two touchdowns, but his last pass was intercepted by Reshad Jones in the end zone with six seconds left.

Jones made an acrobatic interception , tipping the ball three times before he secured it. That set up Jason Sanders' clinching 28-yard field goal on the final play.

Sanders kicked four field goals, including a 52-yarder that put Miami ahead 19-17 midway through the fourth quarter.

Falcons coach Dan Quinn said Jones deserves credit for Tannehill's big completions. "There were some good matchups there," Quinn said. "But Reshad made two great plays at the end."

#  Atlanta Falcons Can't Capitalize on turnovers in Loss to Miami Dolphins

In week six of the NFL, the Atlanta Falcons lost to the Miami Dolphins 27-17. The Falcons were able to force four turnovers by the Dolphins, but were not able to capitalize on them.

The Falcons offense was stagnant for most of the game. Quarterback Matt Ryan was only able to complete 17 of 33 passes for a total of 212 yards and one touchdown. Ryan was also sacked four times. The lack of an effective passing game allowed the Dolphins defense to stack the box, preventing running back Devonta Freeman from gaining any yards. Freeman was only able to gain 35 yards on 14 carries.

The Falcons only touchdown came late in the fourth quarter when Ryan connected with wide receiver Calvin Ridley for a 26-yard touchdown pass. This brought the Falcons within 10 points of the Dolphins, but they were not able to score again.

The Miami offense was led by quarterback Ryan Tannehill. Tannehill completed 22 of 29 passes for 282 yards and two touchdowns. Wide receiver Kenny Stills led all receivers with six receptions for 97 yards and one touchdown. Running back Kenyan Drake had a solid game, rushing for 78 yards on 18 carries and catching three passes for 21 yards.

The Dolphins scored first, putting together an 11-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a one-yard touchdown run by Drake. The Falcons were able to answer back early in the second quarter when cornerback Brian Poole intercepted a Tannehill pass and returned it 21 yards for a touchdown. This was Poole’s first career interception and touchdown.

The Dolphins retook the lead near the end of the first half when Stills caught a Tannehill pass and ran it into the end zone for a 62-yard touchdown reception. The Dolphins added a field goal near the end of the third quarter, increasing their lead to 20-10.

In the fourth quarter, Ridley caught his touchdown pass from Ryan, followed by a two-point conversion reception by Mohamed Sanu Sr.. This brought the Falcons within 10 points of the Dolphins, but they were not able to score again. With this loss, Atlanta falls to 2-4 on the season.
