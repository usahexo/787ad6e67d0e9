#  What is the blackjack flavour in Gran Canaria?

The blackjack flavour in Gran Canaria is certainly a popular choice for tourists and locals alike. The casinos offer both American and European versions of the game, so it can be tailored to your preference. Blackjack is perfect for those who like a good mix of chance and strategy – while there’s always an element of luck involved, you can improve your chances by making shrewd choices.

# What are the basic rules of blackjack?

The aim of blackjack is to reach 21 points with your first two cards, or come as close as possible without going over. Cards 2-10 are worth face value, while aces are worth either 1 or 11 (your choice). If you get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over, you win! Various other rules may apply depending on the casino you’re playing in, so be sure to check before playing.

# What strategies can I use to improve my chances?

There are a few different strategies you can use when playing blackjack in order to improve your chances. One popular method is called ‘card counting’ – this basically means keeping track of which cards have been played, so you have a better idea of what’s left in the deck. This won’t work if the casino uses more than one deck though, so be sure to check before playing! Another common strategy is called ‘basic strategy’ – this involves making decisions based on the probabilities of different outcomes, rather than keeping track of cards. You can find basic strategy charts online which will tell you what to do in every possible scenario.
