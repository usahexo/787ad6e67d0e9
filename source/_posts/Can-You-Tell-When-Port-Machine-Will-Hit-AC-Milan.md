#  Port Machine Reaches AC Milan

AC Milan announced this week that they have reached an agreement with FC Porto for the transfer of their coveted midfielder, Hector Herrera. The 28-year-old Mexican international has been a fixture in the FC Porto midfield since moving from Pachuca in 2013, making over 200 appearances and winning two Portuguese league titles. He was also a part of the Mexican squad that reached the 2017 Confederations Cup Final.

The midfielder is seen as a replacement for former Milan captain Leonardo Bonucci, who departed for Juventus last summer. While Herrera is not quite as defensively minded as Bonucci, he is considered to be an all-around better player and will fit well into new manager Stefano Pioli’s 4-3-3 formation.

Herrera is not the only player to move from Portugal to Italy this summer, as forward Andre Silva completed a €38 million transfer to AC Milan from Sevilla last month.

#  Port Machine Closing In On AC Milan

Italian football giants AC Milan are in the midst of a defensive crisis, as a number of their first-choice defenders are either injured or suspended. This has given young goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma and his Port Machine side the chance to close in on the Rossoneri.

Milan’s defence looked shaky even before their injury crisis, with just two clean sheets in their last 10 games in all competitions. In that time, they have conceded 15 goals – an average of 1.5 per game. In comparison, Port Machine have conceded just six goals in their last 10 games, and only once in their last five home games.

That is not to say that Port Machine are an entirely defensive team – they do have some excellent attacking players. In particular, forwards Paulo Dybala and Gonzalo Higuain both love scoring goals. However, they are also happy to help out defensively when needed, which makes them dangerous opponents for any team.

Milan’s injury crisis has worsened recently with the news that central defender Leonardo Bonucci will be out for up to six weeks with a hamstring injury. This leaves them with just three fit senior defenders: Alessio Romagnoli, Mateo Musacchio and Cristian Zapata.

#  Port Machine Nears AC Milan Clash

Porto’s Portuguese title win may have been overshadowed domestically by Benfica’s unbeaten season but the Dragões have a partial chance to make up for that on Wednesday night when they face AC Milan in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg.

Milan are having a difficult season by their own standards, currently occupying 7th place in Serie A, some 17 points off the Champions League qualification places. Manager Gennaro Gattuso is coming under increasing pressure and criticism, with calls for his dismissal intensifying after their Coppa Italia semi-final exit to Lazio on Thursday.

The Rossoneri have scored only 30 goals in their 26 league games this season and talismanic striker Gonzalo Higuaín has only found the net six times in Serie A since his move from Juventus last summer. Even veteran goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma has not been immune to criticism, with recent mistakes costing his side dearly.

In contrast, Porto have been prolific in front of goal with 76 goals scored in their 27 Primeira Liga games this season. Moussa Marega is the club’s top scorer with 24 goals in all competitions and he will be looking to add to his tally against Milan on Wednesday night. The Malian international is also joint-top scorer in the Champions League so far this season alongside Lionel Messi and Robert Lewandowski.

Milan will be without defender Alessio Romagnoli who is suspended after being sent off against Lazio while midfielder Lucas Biglia is injured. In contrast, Porto have no suspensions or injury concerns ahead of Wednesday night’s clash at the San Siro.
