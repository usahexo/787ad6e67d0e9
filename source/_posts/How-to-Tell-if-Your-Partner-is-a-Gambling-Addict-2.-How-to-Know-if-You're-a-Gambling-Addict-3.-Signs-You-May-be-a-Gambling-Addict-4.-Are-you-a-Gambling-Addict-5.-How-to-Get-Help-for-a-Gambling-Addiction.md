The signs that someone may be a gambling addict can be difficult to spot. Often, addicts will try to hide their addiction from those around them. However, there are some signs that may indicate that someone is addicted to gambling.

If your partner frequently gambles, and spends more time and money on gambling than they intend to, they may be a gambling addict. If your partner becomes agitated or defensive when you bring up their gambling habit, this may also be a sign of addiction. Additionally, if your partner neglects their responsibilities in order to gamble, this is another sign of addiction.
