The club said in a statement that it had partnered with the “Circus Casino” in Gelsenkirchen to offer the games. The casino is located just a few miles from the club’s Veltins Arena home stadium.

Schalke said that the casino would offer fans of the club the chance to play poker in a “fully licensed and regulated environment.” It added that the casino was also home to a number of restaurants, bars and other leisure facilities.

Andreas Heeren, managing director of Schalke 04, said: “This partnership represents an important step for Schalke 04 as we continue to look for new and innovative ways to engage with our fans.

Gambling Schalke 04, the Bundesliga soccer team, is set to play in a Las Vegas-style casino as part of a new sponsorship deal.

The move coincides with the launch of Nevada's new sports betting market and reflects the growing interest in gambling among professional sports teams.

Schalke 04 said it would open an online casino in partnership with U.S. gaming company MGM Resorts International, which could eventually feature live dealer games streamed from a studio in Las Vegas.

"This is an important step for Schalke 04 towards reaching a new target group and activating them digitally," said Alexander Jobst, marketing director at the club.

Gaming regulators in Nevada have been keen to attract major European soccer clubs as they look to build market share in the face of increasing competition from New Jersey, which also legalized sports betting this year.

British bookmaker William Hill has already agreed deals with six teams including Spanish giants Atletico Madrid and Sevilla.

Gelsenkirchen's football club Schalke 04 has announced that it will be playing its next live casino game in Las Vegas. 
The move is part of an attempt to broaden the club's appeal outside of Germany and attract new fans.
Schalke 04 CEO Christian Heidel commented on the news, saying: "Las Vegas is one of the most exciting and vibrant cities in the world, and we're thrilled to be playing our next game there. We hope that this will help us to grow our fanbase and make Schalke04 even more popular around the globe."

Las Vegas is a natural choice for Schalke 04's next live casino game, as it is home to some of the world's most famous casinos. The city is known for its glitz and glamour, and is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world.

Schalke 04 isn't the only football club to have ventured into the world of live casinos; several other teams have done so in recent years. For clubs like Schalke 04, whose fan base is largely concentrated in their home country, it can be difficult to find new ways to grow their support base. Playing in a live casino can be a way to do that, as it offers fans a unique experience that they can't get anywhere else.

Not all football clubs have been successful with their live casino ventures, however. Earlier this year, English Premier League team West Ham United announced that it was closing its live casino operation due to financial losses. So far, Schalke 04 has not released any details about how much money it plans to lose by playing in Las Vegas.

Nonetheless, Schalke 04's decision to play in Las Vegas is an interesting one, and it will be interesting to see how well it does there.

There are a few Bundesliga sides who like to take a break during their winter break and travel to warmer climes. Schalke are one of those sides, and they’re set to play a poker game in Las Vegas this week.

The Royal Blues will take on Wolfsburg in Sin City in what is sure to be an interesting encounter. Gelsenkirchen-born midfielder Weston McKennie is looking forward to the game, although he’s not expecting it to be easy against one of the best teams in the league.

Schalke have had a solid season so far, with McKennie himself impressing in midfield. He started his career at FC Dallas in the MLS, but has since become a key player for the Royal Blues.

Schalke are currently fourth in the Bundesliga, just two points behind leaders Bayern Munich. However, they do have games in hand on their title rivals and will be looking to close the gap with a good result against Wolfsburg.

The game will take place at the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino, with around 900 fans making the trip over to watch the match. It should be an interesting contest, especially given that both teams like to play attacking football.

Schalke aren’t used to playing poker in vegas FC live casino as much as other teams in top European leagues but there Weston McKennie says Schalkes upcoming Wednesday match against VfL Wolfsburg is an opportunity for them to see how they stack up against some of their stiffest competition yet this season even though domestic casino gaming doesnt hold as much allure stateside as poker tournaments or blackjack games does back home

Schalke 04 Football Club is a professional association football club based in Gelsenkirchen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The club was formed in 1904 as Westfalia Schalke by a group of high school students and first achieved Allied-occupied status playing as "Sport-Club Westfalen". In 1923, four years after the original club's formation, they merged with the rival Schalker Turnverein 1877 to become Sportvereinigung Schalke 1877.

In 1925, Schalke earned its first honours by winning the Nordwestdeutscher championship. It then went on to become the first German team to win a Bundesliga title in 1957–58. Schalke captured consecutive DFB-Pokals in 1960 and 1961. With their third and fourth Bundesliga titles in 1972 and 1974, they qualified for the UEFA Cup for the first time; however, they were knocked out by Scottish side Rangers in the first round. The team enjoyed further success with two second-place finishes in 1977 and 1978.

With Horst Köppel at the helm, Schalke qualified for the Champions League group stage in 1997–98; their campaign was overshadowed by match-fixing allegations made against Köppel and his assistant Rudi Assauer. The allegations resulted in criminal charges being filed against both men, which ultimately led to their departures from the club. In spite of this setback, Schalke finished in second place behind Borussia Dortmund during their 1998–99 campaign.

The following season saw new head coach Huub Stevens lead Schwake 04 to their fifth Bundesliga title: finishing one point ahead of Bayern Munich ensuring automatic qualification for the UEFA Champions League group stage once again. The 2002–03 season saw Stevens guide Schalke through an impressive run in Europe; they reached the semi-finals of both the UEFA Cup and the Champions League – narrowly losing out on away goals to eventual champions Porto and AC Milan respectively. After failing to qualify for both major European tournaments in 2004–05 season, Stevens resigned as head coach[1].

The club appointed Felix Magath as head coach for the 2006–07 season who led them to eighth place in Bundesliga competition but failed to deliver any silverware despite spending significantly on player transfers throughout his tenure[2]; Magath left at the end of that season after receiving heavy criticism from fans due to his perceived negative game style[3]. Ralf Rangnick was appointed head coach on 1 July 2011[4] and led Royal Blues through consecutive fourth-placed finishes before steering them to a runners up spot behind Borussia Dortmund during the 2013/14 campaign – earning direct qualification for another crack at European competition.[5] However Stale Solbakken replaced Rangnick just seven months later citing anxiety problems as a key factor,[6] he was sacked sixteen months into his tenure with record low points totals amassed over two seasons; under Roberto Di Matteo Schalkes form improved slightly but not enough for him keep his job beyond March 2017.[7]

The current head coach is Domenico Tedesco who took over on 1 July 2017 after impressing as manager of second division side Erzgebirge Aue.[8] In his first season at the helm he secured Champions league football via a third place finish in Bundesliga, he also became only sixth coach ever at schalke 04 have won all three major trophies (Bundesliga ,DFB Pokal Germany cup) . On 3 June 2019 it was announced that schalkes las vegas live casino poker venture had been finalized with lasvegasliveroom_com becoming there official sponsor . Club president Clemens Tönnies commented "This partnership gives us access to an international market , we are looking forward too giving our fans around te world thrilling live casino poker experience"
